- Conservative fixes in place but could be improved
- FIFO not properly handling edge cases

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Enhanced PnL Engine** (`enhancedPnLEngine.ts`):
  - Conservative oversell handling (zero-profit for missing data)
  - Proper FIFO lot tracking with validation
  - Comprehensive swap validation before processing
  - Data quality scoring based on processing results
  - Clear separation of matched vs oversell trades

### 2. **Swap Detection Accuracy** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
